# PyLife

This is a naive implementation of Conway's Game of Life using PyGame. It is
modified from an implementation that can be found at

This particular implementation is rather slow and it can be easily improved in
a number of ways. It is meant as a starting point for a lab in an
undergraduate algorithms course. I'm currently using it in this course:

I have a number of faster versions implemented in different ways that I'm not
posting here because it would spoil the fun :).
